                    <p>Hello, this is the landing page for my portfolio.</p>
                    <p>I am currently working in engineering at a company in Vista, CA that makes custom forged wheels.  My mission is to complete this coding bootcamp and transition into the world of web development.</p>
                    <p>I live in Vista, CA.  Originally from North county San Diego.  I don't have any immediate plans to leave but if the opportunity arose and work was available elsewhere I would certainly entertain all of my options.</p>
                    
                    <p>Outside of work I like to:</p>
